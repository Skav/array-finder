# array-finder
Simple project for college to compare performance of binary and linear array search algorithm

What program do is just calculate execution time for binary and linear search in array on given data set, which you can generate from program itself 

For properly working program is recommended to use compiler for x64 systems, in other case with langers arrays you can easly reach OutOfMemoryException
